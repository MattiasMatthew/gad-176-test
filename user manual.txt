Welcome to the Game System User Manual. This manual will guide you through the installation, components, and usage of the system, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

---------- Installation
Unity Installation: Ensure you have Unity installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Unity website.
Project Setup: Create a new Unity project or open an existing one.
Script Integration: Add the provided scripts (GameManager.cs, MainCharacter.cs, and Missile.cs) to your project.


---------- System Components
GameManager
Description: The GameManager handles the overall game state, including game initialization and game over logic.

Key Functions:
Ensures only one instance exists.
Manages the game over state.

MainCharacter
Description: The MainCharacter script controls the player's character movement and responds to game over conditions.

Key Functions:
Handles character movement based on user input.
Stops movement when the game is over.

Missile
Description: The Missile script controls missile behavior, including tracking the MainCharacter and handling collisions.

Key Functions:
Tracks and follows the MainCharacter.
Detects collisions and triggers game over when hitting the MainCharacter.


---------- Using the System
Starting the Game
Scene Setup: Ensure your scene contains the GameManager, MainCharacter, and Missile objects.
GameManager: Add the GameManager script to an empty GameObject named GameManager.
MainCharacter: Add the MainCharacter script to the player's character GameObject.
Missile: Add the Missile script to the missile GameObject and assign the MainCharacter as the target.

Controlling the MainCharacter
Movement: Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move the MainCharacter. The character's speed is determined by the speed variable in the MainCharacter script.
Game Over: When the game is over, the character will stop moving, and a "Game Over!" message will be logged.

Missile Mechanics
Tracking: The missile will automatically track and follow the MainCharacter.
Collision: Upon collision with the MainCharacter, an explosion effect (Kaboom) will be instantiated, the missile will be destroyed, and the game will be set to a game over state.


---------- Troubleshooting
Issue: The MainCharacter is not moving.

Solution: Ensure the isGameOver flag in the MainCharacter script is set to false.
Issue: The missile is not following the MainCharacter.

Solution: Verify that the target in the Missile script is correctly assigned to the MainCharacter.
Issue: The game does not end upon missile collision.

Solution: Ensure the OnTriggerEnter2D method in the Missile script is correctly detecting collisions and that the MainCharacter has a Collider2D component with the "Player" tag.
